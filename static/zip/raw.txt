Why the .zip TLD is a stupid idea:

The .zip TLD creates an amazing opportunity for phishers and scammers everywhere.
Sites that automatically convert link text into clickable hyperlinks will soon convert .zip
filename references into clickable links. Why does this matter? Because when clicked,
a website may not display a page and instead automatically download a .zip file of the same name.
Untechnical users could easily not notice the difference when they click what they think is a zipfile 
in their email and end up installing malware into their organization's environments
For a safe test case of this model, go to https://documents-backup.zip.

There are more than enough TLDs, and .zip serves no purpose except being a powerful
tool in a threat actor's arsenal.

If you manage a network, block .zip TLDs on your network immediately.
If you are a regular user, DO NOT CLICK .zip links and stay watchful online.
